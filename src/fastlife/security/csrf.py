"""
Prevents CSRF attack using cookie and html hidden field comparison.

Fast life did not reinvent the wheel on CSRF Protection.

It use the good old method. A CSRF token is saved in a cookie.
Forms post the CSRF token, and the token in the cookies and the form must match
to process the request, otherwise an exception
{class}`fastlife.security.csrf.CSRFAttack` is raised.

The cookie named is configurabllefia the settings
:attr:`fastlife.config.settings.Settings.csrf_token_name`

While using the `<Form/>` JinjaX tag, the csrf token is always sent.

The cookie is always set when you render any template. At the moment, there is
no way to prevent to set the cookie in the request.
